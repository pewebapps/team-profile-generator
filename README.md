# Team Profile Generator

The Team Profile Generator is an application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team. 
From the input provided, it then generates an HTML file that displays the summaries for each person.

There are three types of employees that you can create. They are:
 * Manager
 * Engineer
 * Intern


The `Manager`, `Engineer` and `Intern` all require a `name`, `id` and `email`.

A `Manager` also includes an `officeNumber`

A `Engineer` also includes there `github` username.

Finally the `Intern` also needs to state the `school` they are / were most recently attending.

A sample output of the html file that is autogenerated can be found [here](https://github.com/pewebapps/team-profile-generator/blob/main/output/team.html).
